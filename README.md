# E.P.L-Tracker

This project was created to get a view of English Premier League teams and their data including the last game, the next game, and who they are playing in the next game.

I learned how to include an API in my code and how to call it to display the information on the page. 

I used Python, Flask, and MySQL database to create all the features of this web application. 

To use this project download the file and create a user. Once created it will take you to the main page. Once you add a team(Premier League Teams) it will be displayed. The first team that you add will be your favorite. 
you can change your favorite team by clicking on the team name and then searching for the team that will replace your favorite team.
