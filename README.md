# E.P.L-Tracker

This project was created to get a view of English Premier League teams and their data including last game, next game who they are playing.

I learned how to include an API into my code and how to call on it to display the information onto the page. 

I used Python, Flask, and MySQL database to create all the features on this web application. 

To use this project download the file and create a user. Once creaated it will take you to the main page. Once you add a team(Premier League Teams) it will be displayed. The first team that you add will be your favorite. 
you can change the favorite team by clicking on the team name and then searching up the team that will replace the favorite team.
